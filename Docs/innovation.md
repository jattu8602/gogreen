## GoGreen — Ideation, Innovation, and Funding Narrative

### One-liner
GoGreen turns everyday mobility into measurable climate wins, routing users to the greenest option and rewarding them for it.

### The Problem
- Urban mobility choices are optimized for time and convenience, not emissions.
- Users lack clear, real-time signals on the eco-cost of their travel decisions.
- Sustainable choices (walking, cycling, public transport, EVs) are often invisible, fragmented, or inconvenient to plan.

### Our Solution
- A mobile companion that recommends eco-optimized routes, quantifies CO2 impact and costs, and rewards sustainable behavior with green points and social recognition.
- AI-assisted eco travel planning that’s local, actionable, and gamified.

---

## Innovation Thesis (Why We Win)

### 1) Eco-Routing Graph that optimizes for CO2, cost, and time
- Multi-objective routing: dynamically balances CO2 emissions, ETA, and out-of-pocket cost per passenger-km.
- Localized emissions models (India-first), with mode libraries for walking, cycling, metro/train, bus, EVs, CNG autos, taxis.
- Personalized weights: adapts to user goals (eco, budget, speed) and learned preferences.

### 2) Behavior Change Engine (Green Points + Social Loops)
- Instant feedback + rewards for lower-emission choices.
- Streaks, challenges, and a sustainability leaderboard to make green travel competitive and fun.
- Smart nudges: “You can save 0.4 kg CO2 and ₹20 if you take bus+walk.”

### 3) Incentive Layer and Marketplace
- Aggregates benefits: transit passes, micromobility credits, EV ride promos, carbon offset bundles.
- B2B hooks for employers, cities, insurers to subsidize green choices and verify impact.

### 4) AI Travel Planner for sustainable itineraries
- Gemini-assisted plans embed low-carbon mobility, eco attractions, and cost controls.
- Converts itineraries into multi-modal routes with CO2 and budget summaries.

### 5) Data Moat
- Route-emissions telemetry, anonymized mobility patterns, and outcome data create proprietary models for city planning, ESG reporting, and enterprise APIs.

## Business Model

- B2C Subscription: premium planner features, unlimited route analytics, ad-free experience.
- B2B/B2G API: route + emissions scoring for mobility apps, fleets, HR wellness, and city dashboards.
- Affiliate & Incentives: commissions from micromobility, transit, EV partners.
- Corporate Programs: employer-sponsored green commuting benefits; verified impact reporting.
- Carbon Credits & Offsets: curated marketplace and margin on transactions.

---

## Market

- India-first urban mobility and climate-tech: hundreds of millions of daily trips.
- Expands globally with localized emission models and transit catalogs.
- Early adopters: eco-conscious commuters, students, budget travelers.

---

## Why Now

- Affordable smartphones + high urban congestion.
- Policy and corporate push for ESG outcomes.
- Rapid expansion of transit systems, micromobility, and EV infrastructure.

---

## Go-to-Market

- University and workplace challenges (green commute competitions).
- City pilots with transit agencies and EV operators.
- Influencer-led eco challenges; partner with travel and fintech super-apps.

---

## Competitive Landscape

- Maps (Google/Apple): optimize for time; CO2 visibility is shallow.
- Fitness apps: great at cycling/walking, weak at multi-modal eco routing.
- Transit apps: strong schedules, limited CO2, incentives, or cross-mode gamification.

GoGreen focuses on everyday behavior change via multi-objective routing and tangible rewards.

## Traction & Milestones (placeholders)

- Pilot: [X] users, [Y] eco-routes, [Z] kg CO2 saved.
- Partnerships: [Transit operator], [Micromobility], [EV ride-hailing].
- Corporate LOIs: [N] companies covering [M] employees.

---

## Metrics (North Stars)

- Monthly Active Users, Routes/MAU, CO2 Saved/Route.
- CAC, LTV, 4/12-week retention, % eco-mode selection.
- B2B API accounts and ARR.

---

## Tech Overview

- Stack: React Native + Expo, Firebase, TomTom Maps, Gemini AI.
- Emissions Models: localized per mode; configurable per city.
- Services: `lib/routeService.ts`, `lib/userService.ts`, `app/services/geminiService.tsx`.
- Security: Firebase rules, Secure Store, least-privilege design.

See `Docs/techstack.md` and `Docs/workflow-architecture-usecases.md`.

## Roadmap

- 0–3 months (MVP): green routing, points, basic leaderboard, metro/bus integration in one city; AI planner v1.
- 3–6 months: incentives marketplace, corporate programs v1, multi-city rollout, premium subscription.
- 6–12 months: B2B API, city dashboards, advanced personalization, carbon offset marketplace.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- Data Accuracy: cross-validated emissions data; transparent ranges and sources.
- Supply Fragmentation: aggregation layer and modular adapters for local operators.
- Engagement: proven loops (points, challenges, community) and value clarity (CO2 + ₹ saved).
- Privacy: anonymized telemetry, opt-in analytics, strict security rules.

---

## Financials (placeholders)

- Unit Economics: blended CAC ₹[X], LTV ₹[Y], payback < [Z] months.
- B2C ARPU: ₹[X]/mo; B2B API pricing tiered by MAU/calls.
- Use-of-Funds: 18-month runway to hit [N] MAU and [M] ARR.

---

## The Ask

- Raising ₹[amount] (or $[amount]) pre-seed/seed.
- Use of Funds:
  - Engineering & Data Science: eco-routing, incentive platform, APIs.
  - Market Expansion: city onboarding, partnerships, GTM.
  - Compliance & Security: data governance, audits.
- Hiring Plan: Founding engineers, data scientist, partnerships lead, city ops.

## Demo Narrative (Investor Walkthrough)

1) User selects destination; app shows eco vs fastest route with CO2 and ₹ savings.
2) Suggests walk+metro or cycle+bus; shows points earned and time trade-off.
3) After trip, route history tallies emissions saved and updates the leaderboard.
4) AI planner builds a weekend eco itinerary and converts days into routes.
